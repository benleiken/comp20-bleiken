Web Programming class at Tufts University 
Department of Computer Science, Spring 2013

2. a5 was my favorite project.

3. a5 was the project I was most proud of because I felt like I learned the
most while writing it.

4. I knew a bit of web programming before taking this class, but I now feel
like I have a sturdier foundation and certainly much more experience and 
knowledge with regard to writing programs for the web. I'm glad to have just
taken this class, seeing as I'll be working as a web developer this summer at
SurveyMonkey and will get to apply my new knowledge and learn a ton more!
