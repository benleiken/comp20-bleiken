<a name="introduction"></a><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>
Scorecenter is a web-based platform for tracking game scores and high score data
for web-based games. As we all know, gamers are naturally competitive and, alas,
prone to taking shortcuts (i.e. cheating). For this reason, it is absolutely
essential that the Scorecenter platform be secure and attack-proof.
</p>

<a name="methodology"></a><h1>Methodology</h1>
<p>
All testing was performed on ctaylo02's code, which was obtained over email.
Alas, some of the code (including posting functionality) was incorrect and,
therefore, did not perform as intended. Thus, most of the security analysis was
done by manually examining ctaylo02's code, rather than running Burp Suite or
any other security testing application.
</p>
<p>
NOTE:
Some attempts were made to correct the bad posting code, but said attempts
proved futile. Most of the vulnerabilities were similar to those present in my
own Scorecenter code, so I ran all tests on my own (operational) code.
</p>



<a name="findings"></a><h1>Abstract of Findings</h1>
<p>There are several security leaks and opportunities for malicious attacks on 
the <span class="italic">ScoreCenter</span> application, 
<ol>
<li>Database Injection
<ul>
<li>Scorecenter, in its current form, is vulnerable to attacks that inject
database queries into the core database, and then use get requests to activate
said queries. </li>
<li>Such attacks compromise the integrity of the database and can involve:
deleting records, adding records, modifying scores, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br />
<li>Lack of Input/Output Validation
<ul>
<li>Scorecenter currently performs no checks on the input provided by users of
the POST API. Thus, malformed inputs/malicious code can
all be added to the database.</li>
<li>Similarly, Scorecenter currently performs no checks on application output.
Thus, if malicious code or incorrect entries were added to the database, Scorecenter could
serve as a potent vector (via the GET API) for sending that information to an unlimited number of
clients.v</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>


<a name="issues"></a><h1>Issues Found</h1>
<ol>
<li><h2>No Input Validation on POST API</h2></li>
<ul>
<li><span class="emph">Location: </span>/submit.json</li>
<li><span class="emph">Severity: </span><span class="high">HIGH</span> - Input
of any type/length can be added to the database!</li>
<li><span class="emph">Description: </span>There are no checks performed on the
input to the game_title, score, or username fields. Thus, input of any
type/length can be added to the database. This could lead to buffer overflow
errors, tons of malformed records, and other serious security problems.
Basically, the keys to the Scorecenter database are in the hands of a any
inspired assailant right now.</li>
<img src="1.tiff" style= "height: 600px; width: 800px" alt="screenshot" />
<li><span class="emph">Resolution: </span> Scorecenter should limit the max
length of inputs and perform checks to ensure basic properties (e.g. that 'score' is
a number) as well as tests to make sure that scripts are not being injected into
the database.</li>
</ul>

<li><h2>Database Injection on POST API</h2></li>
<ul>
<li><span class="emph">Location: </span>submit.json</li>
<li><span class="emph">Severity: </span><span class="high">HIGH</span> Scripts
can be injected into the Mongo database! </li>
<li><span class="emph">Description: </span>
Because no input validation is performed on user inputs via the POST API,
attackers can input malicious database queries to Scorecenter and wreak all
sorts of havoc in the Mongo DB. For example, an attacker could input a script
that finds and replaces a given username with a different username as the
'username' field. The script would then be loaded into the database as the
'username' value for a given entry, any attempt to retrieve the entry would
result in the database query's execution -- thus leading to incorrect
information in the database.

<p>
(NOTE: No Screenshot available because code did not run)
</p>
</li>
<li><span class="emph">Resolution: </span>
Input validation is, again, key here. Most importantly, all inputs should be
sanitized to remove all HTML tags (thereby 'disarming' any malicious scripts).

</li>
</ul>

<li><h2>No Output Validation on GET/User Search APIs</h2>
<ul>
<li><span class="emph">Location: </span>main.php</li>
<li><span class="emph">Severity: </span><span class="high">Medium to High</span>
Anything (even malicious code) present in the database can be served to a client
via a GET request, with no security validation</li>
<li><span class="emph">Description: </span> There is a no output validation on
the contents of the Scorecenter database. Thus, if anyone gains unauthorized
access to the Mongo DB, they have complete control over content that could be
and eventually will be seen by users. As we have seen, with no input validation
and the potential for database injection -- the likelihood the the Scorecenter
database could be breached is high, so output validation is strongly
recommended.
</li>
<img src="2.tiff" style= "height: 600px; width: 800px" alt="screenshot" />

<li><span class="emph">Resolution: </span>
Remove HTML tags from all database outputs, remove special characters, etc.
Ensure that no binary/executable files are being outputted from the database. 
</li>
</ul>
</li>


</ol>


<a name="conclusion"></a><h1>Conclusion</h1>
<p>There are many security leaks in the <span class="italic">Scorecenter</span> 
application as it presently stands, putting users at risk and allowing outside 
parties to overwrite and/or delete scores at will. The database is especially
vulnerable to attacks -- efforts to protect it are of paramount importance.</p>
